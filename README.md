# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis

This project explores a Music Store Database using SQL to uncover valuable insights about customers, tracks, genres, artists, and sales performance.

It was created as part of my SQL learning journey to strengthen data analysis and database querying skills.

The dataset used is a typical Chinook or Music Store sample database, containing tables like:

Artist, 
Album, 
Track, 
Genre, 
Customer, 
Invoice, 
Invoice_Line
Employee
